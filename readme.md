Haxe-FirebaseðŸ”¥
==============

This is a simple extern wrapper lib for firebase.
Currently only the javascript target is supported.

To get started, include

    <script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/3.6.0/firebase.js"></script> 

In the html file you are going to use, then all things in haxe-firebase should work 
as written in the firebase documentation.
